# Aerofit Treadmill Customer Profiling Project

## Project Overview

Aerofit Treadmill Customer Profiling Project aims to analyze customer characteristics for each AeroFit treadmill product and provide insights for better recommendations to new customers. The project includes descriptive analytics, construction of two-way contingency tables, computation of probabilities, and data visualization.

## Dataset

The dataset (Aerofit_treadmill.csv) contains information on individuals who purchased a treadmill from AeroFit stores, including features such as product purchased, age, gender, education, marital status, usage, income, fitness, and miles.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Import and Exploration:**
   - Checked the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
   - Detected outliers using boxplots and the "describe" method.

2. **Feature Analysis:**
   - Explored the effect of features like marital status, age on the product purchased using countplot, histplots, boxplots.

3. **Marginal Probability:**
   - Represented marginal probabilities using pandas.crosstab.

4. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Checked correlation among different factors using heatmaps and pair plots.

5. **Customer Profiling:**
   - Categorized users based on customer characteristics.

6. **Probability Calculation:**
   - Calculated marginal and conditional probabilities.

7. **Recommendations and Actionable Insights:**
   - Provided actionable insights and recommendations based on the inferences.
