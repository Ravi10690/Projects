## Problem Statement

Target, a leading retail corporation, aims to gain a comprehensive understanding of its e-commerce operations in Brazil. By analyzing historical data, the company seeks to identify trends, uncover customer behavior patterns, and assess the impact on the economy. The insights derived from this analysis will enable Target to make informed decisions, optimize operations, and enhance customer experiences.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset comprises multiple tables containing information about customers, orders, payments, products, sellers, and geolocation data. It covers a significant time period, allowing for the analysis of e-commerce trends and seasonality. The data includes details such as customer locations, order details, payment methods, product information, and delivery details.

## Key Questions Explored

1. Is there a growing trend in e-commerce in Brazil, and can any seasonality patterns be observed?
2. What are the preferred times for Brazilian customers to make purchases?
3. How has e-commerce evolved across different states in Brazil?
4. What is the impact of e-commerce on the economy, including revenue growth and freight costs?
5. How do sales, freight values, and delivery times vary across different states?
What are the preferred payment methods used by Brazilian customers

## Analysis Steps

1. Performed exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's characteristics, data types, and time periods covered.
2. Conducted time-series analysis to identify trends and seasonality in e-commerce orders and payment values.
3. Analyzed customer purchasing behavior, including preferred times and payment methods, through cohort analysis.
4. Investigated the impact on the economy by examining revenue growth, freight costs, and state-wise distributions.
5. Evaluated sales, freight values, delivery times, and deviations from estimated delivery dates across different states.
6. Identified top-performing and underperforming states based on various metrics, such as order volumes, freight costs, and delivery times.
7. Generated visualizations (tables and graphs) to effectively communicate insights and findings.

## Conclusion
The analysis revealed a significant growing trend in e-commerce in Brazil, with a notable increase in order volumes and payment values year-over-year. Seasonality patterns were observed, with peaks during specific months. Brazilian customers demonstrated a preference for making purchases in the afternoon and evening hours, and credit card payments were the most popular payment method.

The impact on the economy was substantial, with a remarkable 137% increase in revenue from 2017 to 2018 (January to August). State-wise analysis highlighted variations in freight costs, delivery times, and deviations from estimated delivery dates, providing insights for optimizing operations and improving customer experiences.

The findings from this project will enable Target to make data-driven decisions, enhance its e-commerce strategies, and cater to the evolving needs of Brazilian customers more effectively.
